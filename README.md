# Web Sudoku

## Overview

Web Sudoku is a web-based application for playing Sudoku. This project is designed to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for solving Sudoku puzzles online.

## Why?

-   Challenge myself
-   I like sudoku
-   The Sudoku app I have has very annoying ads every other number input or when generating a new board
-   An opportunity to learn about brute force, backtracking algorithms, recursive functions, and a lot more.
-   Get back into the "game" development world :D

### Disclaimer

This project was created solely for learning and leisure purposes. As such, it does not adhere to best practices, coding guidelines, or performance optimizations. The focus was on experimenting with algorithms, rather than on code quality or efficiency improvements. Use (OR not) at your own discretion, as the project may contain inefficient or unconventional implementations.

### AI

No AI-based autocompletion or chat conversation was used in the development of the algorithms implemented here.
